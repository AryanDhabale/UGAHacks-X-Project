    """
    Launches the Balance Sheet Challenge game where users are presented with a company balance sheet 
    (with a hidden mistake) and a follow-up question. Users must identify the misclassified item.

    Features:
    - Displays a dummy company balance sheet with an intentional error (e.g., a liability misclassified as an asset).
    - Presents a question about the balance sheet.
    - Provides four multiple-choice answer buttons.
    
    Tech Stack:
    ‚úÖ Streamlit ‚Äì Provides an interactive balance sheet analysis game.
    ‚úÖ MongoDB ‚Äì (Placeholder) Would store past challenges, user attempts, and progress.
    ‚úÖ Pinata ‚Äì (Placeholder) Would host financial statement PDFs for reference.
    
    Note: This is a prototype. The buttons currently provide confirmation feedback only.
